A very simple Spring Web Flow and Spring Web project.

The eventual goals are to demonstrate how to:

. Set up a Web Flow project using minimal Java configuration
. Integrate Web Flow with Web (eg delegating to it for view rendering)
. Write various kinds of tests against Web Flow applications
. Deploy a highly-available Web Flow application to Cloud Foundry

Features of Web Flow will only be used so far as necessary to demonstrate their use with Web or Cloud Foundry.
